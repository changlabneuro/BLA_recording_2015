# Hierarchical models for spike counts

## Model 1

Here, we model spike counts in the time window of interest as drawn from a Poisson distribution:
$$
\begin{aligned}
N_i &\sim \mathrm{Poisson}(\lambda_i) \\
\lambda_i &= \beta_{0 cu} + \beta_{1cu} R_i + \beta_{2cu} \tau_i 
  + \beta_{3cu} R_i \tau_i \\
  \beta_{j \cdot u} &\sim \mathrm{Normal}(\mu_{j}, \Sigma_j) \\
  (\mu_j, \Sigma_j) &\sim \text{Normal-Inverse-Wishart}(\mu_{0j}, \lambda_j, \Psi_j, \nu_j)
\end{aligned}
$$
with $N_i$ the spike count on trial $i$, $c(i)$ and $u(i)$ the choice (outcome type) and unit for that trial, $R_i$ the reward on the trial (coded as a percent of maximum) and $\tau_i$ the trial type (cued vs free choice). 

In other words, we model the regression coefficients for each unit as drawn from multivariate normal distributions with mean $\mu$ and covariance $\Sigma$, and we are particularly interested in inferring these parameters for the entire population of cells.

# To do:
- non-additive trial type effects (cued vs choice treated as unrelated?)
- negative binomial or added gaussian in linear predictor
- model of separate subpopulations

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
